# Let's play Wordle

My personal Wordle game so I can pay indefinitely ðŸ˜…

This project was inspired by [youtube video](https://youtu.be/SyWeex-S6d0?si=2iEa-wotLtEf1EG5) by pixegami - thank you!

Some of the additions I want to add:

- [ ] show unused letters
- [ ] store words that were already used in the previous games
- [ ] store statistics


## Setup

For this project I used `uv` for package management and `ruff` for code style. 

1. Install `uv`
2. [Optional] Create virtual environment
3. Install dependencies with `uv pip install -r pyproject.toml`

## How to play the game

This game is designed to be played in your terminal.

1. Run `python wordle.py`
2. Follow the instructions
3. Have fun and try your best :)
